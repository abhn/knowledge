# Apps

There are some apps that I've used for a while now, and then some that I started using recently and trying to get into the habit of using regularly.

## TickTick
I was looking for a cross platform tool that'd help me with my GTD setup and TickTick had everything I needed. Plus it also has webapp support which Things didn't have, which was a deal breaker for me.

I use a hotkey to always be one key combination away from entering a task to my inbox, which makes it easy to just note down something the instance it comes to mind.

## Alfred
My life has completely changed ever since I found Alfred. I'd highly recommend the powerpacks addon.

## Obsidian
Second brain, to take notes and edit this wiki

### Obsidian plugins
Excalidraw - To draw mindmaps and other flow charts
Periodic notes - To schedule daily and weekly periodic notes

## Karabiner
I use Karabiner for low level keyboard manipulation

### Goku
Goku generates a config from `~/.config/karabiner.edn` upon running the `goku` command
